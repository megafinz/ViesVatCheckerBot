# What's This?

This is a [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) implementation for checking the validity of VAT numbers in [VIES](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies) (VAT Information Exchange System).

# What Does It Do?

You can submit a VAT number that will be checked in VIES. If the number is valid, the bot will tell you exactly that. If the number is not valid, the bot will store the number and check it periodically until it becomes valid. The bot will notify you when that happens.

You can do the same manually here: https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies

# How Does It Do That?

Code is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)/[Node.js](https://nodejs.dev) that is intended to be deployed on [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/). [Telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) is a framework of choice for handling Telegram bot interactions.

## Why Do I Use What I Use?

- **Serverless**: I didn't want to pay for the hosting (serverless is basically free for small workloads) and also wanted to try, well, serverless.
- **Azure**: because I already have an account and have a bit of familiarity with the ecosystem.
- **Typescript/Node.js**: quick feedback loop for hacking/exploring solutions, can be deployed on **Azure**.
- **Telegram**: I use it a lot so wanted to explore implementing bots. Simple solution for providing UI and notifications.
- **Telegraf**: simple intuitive API.

## Implementation Details

There are 3 functions:

- **TgBotApi**: HTTP Trigger that sets up Telegram webhooks and command handlers upon initialization. Webhook invocations will trigger command handlers which then delegate execution to a different HTTP Trigger: **HttpApi**.

- **HttpApi**: HTTP Trigger that can perform various actions with VAT numbers. This function can store VAT numbers in the MongoDB database and validate them against VIES API.

- **TimerTrigger**: Timer Trigger that checks all pending VAT numbers once an hour and notifies Telegram users when those numbers become valid.

## Run/Debug

You can't run this as is.

0. Use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with [Azure Tools extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack).
1. [Create a Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot). Put it's access token into settings file (see step 6).
2. Go to **Azure > Databases** pane and create new "MongoDB" database (in Azure it's **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API**). Put the connection string into settings file (see step 6).
3. Since Telegram can only invoke webhooks for publicly available URLs, you'll need something like [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to setup a proxy that will redirect traffic to your app running on `localhost`. Put the proxy URL into settings file (see step 6).
4. Go to **Azure > Functions** pane, click on **Local Project**'s initialize button.
5. Go to **Run and Debug** pane and try to run the project. Follow the steps to connect your project to your Azure Account.
6. Modify `local.settings.json` at the root of the repo. It should contain following settings:
```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "YOUR_AUTOGENERATED_AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING",
    "MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING": "YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING",
    "TG_BOT_TOKEN": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN",
    "TG_BOT_API_URL": "LOCAL_TUNNEL_OR_NGROK_OR_WHATEVER_BASE_URL/api/TgBotApi",
    "TG_BOT_API_TOKEN": "", // not required for local deployment
    "HTTP_API_URL": "http://localhost:7071/api/HttpApi",
    "HTTP_API_TOKEN": "", // not required for local deployment
    "MAX_PENDING_VAT_NUMBERS_PER_USER": 10,
    "VAT_NUMBER_EXPIRATION_DAYS": 90
  }
}
```
7. You can now run your functions locally (either through `npm run` or through the VS Code's **Run and Debug** pane).
8. You can also deploy your functions to Azure using **Azure > Functions** pane.
9. After you've deployed your functions, you can now update **Azure > Functions > {Your Project} > Application Settings** to contain the same settings that you added to `local.settings.json`:
   - `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING` and `TG_BOT_TOKEN` will be the same.
   - `TG_BOT_API_URL` is the URL of **TgBotApi** function (without `code` param).
   - `TG_BOT_API_TOKEN` is the auth code of **TgBotApi** function.
   - `HTTP_API_URL` is the URL of **HttpApi** function (without `code` param).
   - `HTTP_API_TOKEN` is the auth code of **HttpApi** function.
   - Note that you can retrieve the URL with code by selecting "Copy Function URL" in the context menu of a specific deployed function (e.g. `https://{your-project-name}.azurewebsites.net/api/httpapi?code={http-api-function-auth-code}`).
   - `MAX_PENDING_APP_NUMBERS_PER_USER` should be self-explanatory.
   - `VAT_NUMBER_EXPIRATION_DAYS` defines a period after which VAT number should stop being monitored (to handle the case when it never becomes valid).

# Why Does It Do That?

## Main Use Case

When you register an entity in EU, chances are that you need to be registered in VIES as well. It can take some time during which you'll probably get bored manually entering your VAT number and seeing that it's not yet valid. This bot is aimed to automate VAT number validation for you.

## Alternative Use Case

You need to verify that some other entity has a valid VAT number for transactions within EU.
